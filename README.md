# daisxmms2skin
A skin / client for xmms2 written in Python using Qt5 (pyqt5)
I have created this client to make it easier to manage playlists with the Xmms2 audio player, I hope others will like it too.

I am new to publishing software so if I do not do something straight away it will probably be through not knowing something so please bear with me and I will do my best to have everything running smoothly as soon as possible.

Here is a screenshot of what it looks like, I hope to have all the files uploaded real soon.
