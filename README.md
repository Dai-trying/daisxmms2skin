# daixmms2client
A client for xmms2 written in Python using Qt5 (pyqt5)
I have created this client to make it easier to manage playlists with the Xmms2 audio player, I hope others will like it too.

I am new to publishing software so if I do not do something straight away it will probably be through not knowing something so please bear with me and I will do my best to have everything running smoothly as soon as possible.

I have created a website to give you some information on usage and it can be found here :- http://www.dsbnet.tk
